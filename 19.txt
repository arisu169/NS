19) Demonstrate Intrusion Detection System using Snort Tool

To demonstrate Snort, an open-source intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS), follow these steps to install, configure, and run Snort on your system:

Steps to Set Up Snort:

1. Install Snort on Linux (Ubuntu example):
   - Open a terminal and run the following commands:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install snort
     ```

2. Configure Snort:
   - After installation, you need to configure Snort. You will be prompted to configure the network interface and other settings during installation.
   - If you want to manually configure, edit the `snort.conf` file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf
     ```
   - Set the `HOME_NET` variable to the network range you want to monitor. For example:
     ```
     var HOME_NET [192.168.1.0/24]
     ```

3. Running Snort in IDS Mode:
   - Snort can run in different modes: IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or IPS (Intrusion Prevention System).
   - To run Snort in IDS mode, use the following command:
     ```
     sudo snort -A console -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
     ```
   - Replace `eth0` with your network interface (use `ifconfig` to check).

4. Snort Rules:
   - Snort uses rules to detect malicious traffic. By default, Snort comes with a set of rules located in `/etc/snort/rules/`.
   - You can update the rules regularly or add custom rules.
   - Example of a simple rule to detect ICMP echo requests (ping):
     ```
     alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP Echo Request"; sid:1000001;)
     ```

5. Monitor Traffic:
   - After running Snort, monitor the traffic for any intrusion attempts.
   - The Snort console will output alerts if any suspicious activity is detected.

Example Output:
```
01/01-12:00:00.000000  [**] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Echo Request [**] [Priority: 3] {ICMP} 192.168.1.100 -> 192.168.1.200
```
This output indicates that Snort detected an ICMP Echo Request from IP `192.168.1.100` to `192.168.1.200`.
